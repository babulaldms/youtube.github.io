        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Meaning nature and scope of economics</h3><br>
       <h4><b><i>Definition: </i></b>Economics is that branch of social science which is concerned with the study of
how individuals, households, firms, industries and government take decision relating to the
allocation of limited resources to productive uses, so as to derive maximum gain or
satisfaction.</h4> <br>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">NATURE OF ECONOMICS</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="badge badge-secondary" style="font-size: 20px">SCIENCE</span> <span class="badge badge-secondary" style="font-size: 20px">ARTS</span></p>
<p><b><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-dark" style="font-size: 20px">Economics is a Science</span></b></p>
<p>Science is an organised branch of knowledge, that analyses cause
and effect relationship between economic agents.</p>
<p>Economics helps in integrating
various sciences such as mathematics, statistics, etc.</p>
<p><b> <span class="badge badge-secondary bg-danger" style="font-size: 15px">Positive Economics</span></b><br>The relationship between two
variables but does not give any value judgment.<br> It deals with facts
about the entire economy.</p>

<p><b> <span class="badge badge-secondary bg-danger" style="font-size: 15px">Normative Economics</span></b><br>It passes value judgment.<br> It is concerned with economic goals and policies to attain these goals.</p><br>
<p><b><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-dark" style="font-size: 20px">Economics is an Art</span></b></p>
<p>Economics has various branches like production, distribution,
consumption and economics, that provide general rules and laws that are capable of solving
different problems of society.</p>
<br>
<p>Therefore, economics is considered as science as well as art, i.e.<b><i> science in terms of its
methodology and arts as in application.</i></b></p><br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">SCOPE OF ECONOMICS</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Micro</span>----<span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Macro</span></p>

<p><b> <span class="badge badge-secondary bg-warning" style="font-size: 15px;color: black;">Micro Economics</span></b><br>The part of economics whose subject matter of study is individual units, i.e. a consumer, a household, a firm, an industry, etc.</p>
<p>It studies consumer behaviour, product pricing, firm’s behaviour. Factor pricing, etc.</p>
<p><b> <span class="badge badge-secondary bg-warning" style="font-size: 15px;color: black;">Macro Economics</span></b><br>It is that branch of economics which studies the entire economy, instead of individual units, i.e. level of output, total investment, total savings, total
consumption, etc.</p>
<p>It covers areas like national income, general price level, the balance of trade and balance of payment, level of employment, level of savings and investment.</p>
<p><i>The fundamental difference between micro and macro economics lies in the scale of
study.</i></p>
<p>In <b>Microeconomics</b>, more importance is given to the determination of price,
whereas <b>Macroeconomics</b> is concerned with the determination of income of the economy as a
whole.</p>

      <h3 class="bg-danger rounded" style="text-align: center;color:white;">CENTRAL ECONOMIC PROBLEMS OF AN ECONOMY</h3><br>

      <p>Economic problems asserts that an economy's finite resources are insufficient to satisfy all human wants and needs.<br> Economics involves the study of how to allocate resources in conditions of scarcity.</p>
      <p>Scarcity is evident due to the availability of limited resources, and human needs having no limit. Therefore, this
variation between the supply and demand leads to the formation of<b> central problems of an economy.</b></p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>The central problems of an economy revolve around these factors:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><b>What to produce?</b></li>
  <p>It is related to the type of goods and services that need to be produced and the quantity to be produced.<br>Since resources are in limited quantities, producing more of one good will result in less production of the other.</p>
  <li><b>How to produce?</b></li>
  <p>This aspect deals with the process or technique by which the goods and services can be produced.<br><b><i>There are two
techniques that can be used for producing, which are:</i></b>
<ul>
  <li>Labour Intensive Techniques</li>
  <li>Capital Intensive Techniques</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The choice of technique for production depends on the availability of the resource in that nation, and hence resource allocation becomes a challenge.</p>

  <li><b>For whom to produce?</b></li>
  <p>This problem deals with determining the people who will be the final consumers of the goods produced.</p>
  <p>As the resources are scarce in an economy, it becomes difficult to cater to all sections of society.</p>
  <p>Such a situation arises due to the difference in income distribution among the population, which causes a change in buying behaviour.</p>
</ol><br>
<h3 class="bg-dark rounded" style="text-align: center;color:white;">The Circular Flow of Economic Activity</h3><br>
<h4><b>Important Terms: </b></h4>
<p><b>Households:</b><br> Households are the owners of factors of production—land, labour, capital and entrepreneurial ability. They sell the services of these factors and receive income in return in the form of rent, wages, and interest and profit respectively.</p>
<p><b>Firms:</b><br> The decision to manufacture goods and services is taken by a firm.Firms produce goods and services to make a
profit.</p>
<p><b>Government:</b><br> The government plays a key role in all types of economic systems—capitalist, socialist and mixed. In a capitalist
economy, the government does not interfere. It simply establishes and protects property rights. It sets standards for weights and measures, and the monetary system.</p>
<h5 class="bg-warning rounded" style="text-align: center;display: inline;padding: 5px;">The Circular Flow in a Two-Sector Economy</h5><br>
<br>
<img class="shadow-lg" src="2cycle.jpg" alt="Responsive image" style="width: 100%;border-radius: 50px; height: 400px;"><br><br>
<h4><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Inner Circle</span></h4>
<p>Consumers or households own all the factors of production, that is, land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, which are also called productive resources.<br>They sell them to firms for producing goods and services.<br>The sale of goods and services by firms to
consumers in the product market is shown in the lower portion of the inner circle from left to right.<br><b><i>These are the real flows of goods and services from firms to consumers which are linked with productive resources from consumers to firms through the medium of
exchange</i></b></p>
<h4><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Outer Circle</span></h4>
<p>The purchase of goods and services in the product market by consumers is their consumption expenditure which becomes the revenue of the firms.<br>The expenditure of firms in buying productive resources in the factor market from the consumers becomes the incomes of
households.</p>
<br>
<h5 class="bg-warning rounded" style="text-align: center;display: inline;padding: 5px;">The Circular Flow in a Three-Sector Economy</h5><br>
<h4>We add the government sector so as to make it a three-sector closed model of circular flow of economic activity.</h4>
<br>
<img class="shadow-lg" src="3cycle.jpg" alt="Responsive image" style="width: 100%;border-radius: 50px; height: 400px;"><br><br>
<h4><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Govt. - Household</span></h4>
<p>Taxes in the form of personal income tax and commodity taxes paid by the household sector are outflows (or leakages) from the circular flow.<br>The government purchases the services of the households, makes transfer payments in the form of old age pensions, unemployment relief, sickness benefit, etc., and also spends on them to provide certain social services like education, health, housing, water, parks and other facilities.</p>
<h4><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Govt. - Business</span></h4>
<p>All types of taxes paid by the business sector to the government are leakages from the circular flow.<br>The government purchases all its
requirements of goods of all types from the business sector.</p>
<br>
<h5 class="bg-warning rounded" style="text-align: center;display: inline;padding: 5px;">The Circular Flow in a Four-Sector Economy</h5><br>
<h4>We add the Foreign sector so as to make it a four-sector closed model of circular flow of economic activity.</h4>
<br>
<img class="shadow-lg" src="4cycle.jpg" alt="Responsive image" style="width: 100%;border-radius: 50px; height: 400px;"><br><br>
<h5>Exports are an injection or inflows into the circular flow of money. On the other hand, imports are leakages from the circular flow.</h5>
<br>
<h4><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Abroad - Household</span></h4>
<p>The household sector buys goods imported from abroad and makes payment for them which is a leakage from the circular flow of
money.<br>The householder's receives transfer payments from the foreign sector for the services rendered by them in foreign countries.</p>
<h4><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-primary" style="font-size: 20px">Abroad - Business</span></h4>
<p>the business sector exports goods to foreign countries and its receipts are an injection in the circular flow or money.<br>The business sector makes payments to the foreign sector for imports оf capital goods, machinery, raw materials, consumer goods, and services from abroad. These are the leakages from the circular flow of money.</p>
<br>
<h4>These outflows and inflows as through the foreign sector which is also called the <b>“Balance of Payments Sectors”</b></h4>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">National Income: Concepts and Measurements</h3><br>
      <p>The National Income is the total amount of income accruing to a country from economic activities in a year time. It includes payments made to all resources either in the form of wages, interest, rent, and profits.</p>
      <h5><span class="badge badge-secondary bg-info" style="font-size: 20px;">Financial Year</span>1st April to 31st March of Next Year (IN INDIA)</h5><br>
      <h4>CONCEPTS OF NATIONAL INCOME:</h4>
      <ol>
        <b><li>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</li></b>
        <p>The total market value of all final goods and services currently produced within the domestic territory of a country in 
        a year.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It measures the market value of annual output of goods and services currently produced.</li>
            <li>For calculating GDP accurately, all goods and services produced in any given year must be counted only once so as to avoid
            double counting.</li>
            <li>GDP includes only currently produced goods and services in a year.<br> Market transactions involving goods produced in the previous periods are not included in GDP of the current year.</li>
            <li>GDP refers to the value of goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country by nationals or non-nationals.</li>
          </ul><br>
        <b><li>Gross National Product (GNP)</li></b>
        <p>Gross National Product is the total market value of all final goods and services produced in a year.<br> GNP includes net factor income from abroad whereas GDP does not.</p>
        <p class="bg-dark rounded" style="display: inline;padding: 5px;color: white">GNP = GDP + Net factor income from abroad</p><br><br>
        <p class="bg-warning rounded" style="display: inline;padding: 5px;"><b>Net factor income from abroad = </b> </p><p> Factor income received by Indian nationals from abroad<b> – </b> factor income paid to foreign nationals working in India.</p>
        
        <b><li>Net National Product (NNP) at Market Prices</li></b>
        <p>NNP is the market value of all final goods and services after providing for depreciation.</p>
        <p class="bg-dark rounded" style="display: inline;padding: 5px;color: white">NNP = GNP – Depreciation</p><br>
        <p><b>Depreciation: </b> Depreciation is the consumption of fixed capital or fall in the value of fixed capital due to wear and tear.</p>

        <b><li>Net National Product (NNP) at Factor Cost or National Income</li></b>
        <p>NNP at factor cost or National Income is the sum of wages, rent, interest and profits paid to factors for their contribution to the production of goods and services in a year.</p>
         <p class="bg-primary rounded" style="display: inline;padding: 5px;color: white">NNP at Factor Cost = NNP at Market Price – Indirect Taxes + Subsidies.</p><br><br>
        <b><li>Personal Income</li></b>
        <p>Personal income is the sum of all incomes actually received by all individuals or households during a given year.</p>
        <p>Personal Income = National Income – Social Security contributions – corporate income taxes – undistributed corporate profits + transfer payments.</p>
        <b><li>Disposable Income</li></b>
        <p>From personal income if we deduct personal taxes like income taxes, personal property taxes etc. what remains is called disposable income.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Disposable Income = Personal income – personal taxes</li>
          <li>Disposable Income = consumption + saving.</li>
          <h5><i>Disposable Income can either be consumed or saved.</i></h5>
        </ul>

      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4>MEASUREMENT OF NATIONAL INCOME:</h4>
      <h5>National Income can be measured by three methods :</h5>
      <ol>
        <b><li>Output or Production method</li></b>
        <p>The economy is divided into different sectors such as agriculture, fishing, mining, construction, manufacturing, trade and ommerce, transport,communication and other services. Then, the gross product is found out by adding up the net values of all the production that has taken place in these sectors during a given year.</p>
        <p><i>The advantage of this method is that it reveals the contributions and relative importance and of the different sectors
        of the economy.</i></p>
        <b><li>Income method </li></b>
        <p>National income is obtained by summing up of the incomes of all individuals in the country.</p>
        <p>National income is calculated by adding up the rent of land, wages and salaries of employees, interest on capital, profits of
        entrepreneurs and income of self-employed people.</p>
        <p><i>The great advantage of indicating the distribution of national income among different income groups such as landlords, capitalists, workers, etc.</i></p>
        <b><li>Expenditure method</li></b>
        <p>This method arrives at national income by adding up all the expenditure made on goods and services during a year</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expenditure on consumer goods and services by individuals and households denoted by <b>C</b>.</li>
          <li>Expenditure by private business enterprises on capital goods and on making additions to inventories or stocks in a year. This is called gross domestic private investment denoted by <b>I</b>.</li>
          <li>Government’s expenditure on goods and services i.e. government purchases denoted by <b>G</b>.</li>
          <li>Expenditure made by foreigners on goods and services of the national economy over and above what this economy spends on the
          output of the foreign countries i.e. exports – imports denoted by <b>(X – M)</b>.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p class="bg-dark rounded" style="display: inline;padding: 5px;color: white">GDP = C + I + G + (X – M).</p><br>
      </ol>
      <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Difficulties in the Measurement of National Income:</h4>
      <h5>
        <ol>
          <li>The treatment of non-monetary transactions such as the services of housewives and farm output consumed at home.</li><br>
          <li>The treatment of the government in national income accounts.<br>Contribution of general government activities will be equal to the amount of wages and salaries paid by the government</li><br>
          <li>The treatment of income arising out of the foreign firm in a country.<br>Profits earned by foreign companies are
          credited to the parent company.</li><br>
        </ol>
      </h5>
      <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Special Difficulties of Measuring National Income in Underdeveloped Countries :</h4><br>
      <h5>
        <ol>
          <li>The prevalence of nonmonetised transactions in such countries so that a considerable part of the output does not come into the market at all.</li><br>
          <li>Because of illiteracy, most producers have no idea of the quantity and value of their output and do not keep regular accounts.<br> This makes the task of getting reliable information very difficult.</li><br>
          <li>An individual may receive income partly from farm ownership, partly from manual work in industry in the slack season,
          etc.<br> This makes the task of estimating national income very difficult.</li><br>
          <li>An assessment of output produced by self-employed agriculturist, small producers and owners of household enterprises in the unorganized sectors requires an element of guesswork.<br> Which makes the figure of national income unreliable.</li><br>
          <li>Inadequacy, non-availability and unreliability of statistics is a great handicap in measuring national income in these
          countries.</li><br>
